# SCSS Solar System

A rotating solar system built with SCSS and HTML. The earth is now comprised of 4 rotating elements -

- 1) the earth orbits the sun
- 2) the image of the earth rotates 
- 2) the image of clouds rotate
- 3) the dark side to the planet spins counterclockwise to #1

The earth itself is a little too small for my liking and therefore it's a little difficult to see the detail but it's all there.

Please note that this is an incomplete demo.
